# Set up, initialize, and interact with PostgreSQL database by Python

## Overview
This project focuses on installing the PostgreSQL database on the computer, performing initialization of the database, managing user accounts, and performing some queries on the database. Next, use the Python language to convert data files to facilitate high-speed data transmission. Also perform data queries, and load data into the database through Python.

## What will be done in the project?
- Initialize and load data into PostgreSQL RDBMS
- Cumulative aggregation and ranking in SQL
- Performance tuning for SQL queries
- Explore datatypes in Python
- Data processing using Pandas
- Convert CSV files into JSON files to improve the efficiency of data engineering pipelines by Python
- Load data files into database using Python

## Dataset used
The dataset used is retail data consisting of 6 tables loaded into the "retail_db" database within PostgreSQL, including:
1. Categories
2. Customers
3. Departments
4. Order_items
5. Orders
6. Products

## Project components
1. Initialize and load data into PostgreSQL RDBMS
2. Process some data using Python
3. File format converter using Python
4. Loading files to database using Python
